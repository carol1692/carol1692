<h1> Hi amazing person, welcome to my profile ðŸ˜‰ </h1>

At moment I'm still feeling like a developer student, and to be sincere Idk if one day this feeling will pass

But I can say that I've been working with I.T since 2016, at IBM Brazil and EY(Ernst & Young) Brazil. Started as a System Admin but in 2021 became a Python developer and since then I'm working with python and javascript as well.

I'm not super active online the last few years, but I like to be always in "movement", it means that my interests renew time at time, right now I'm studying things as languages(programs languages or not), have a lot of contact with animations/cartoons and reading books.  

I doubt someone will read this. But it's fun renovate this profile when I'm feeling happy and calm after so many years feeling I was in a race against the time.
