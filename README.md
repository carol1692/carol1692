<h1> Hi amazing person, welcome to my profile ðŸ˜‰ </h1>

At moment I'm still feeling like a developer student, and to be sincere Idk if one day this feeling will pass

But I can say that I have work with I.T since 2016 at IBM Brazil. Started as a System Admin and since 2021 as a Python developer

I realized that because of confidentiality of the company, people don't know what I'm capable to do, 
so this profile is to show it and the progress of my life as a developer
